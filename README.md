# Bubble Sort Visualizer  

## Description  
Bubble Sort Visualizer is a Flutter application designed to provide an intuitive and interactive way to learn and understand the Bubble Sort algorithm. This project simplifies complex sorting concepts through visual representation, helping users grasp how Bubble Sort works step by step. It’s an ideal tool for students, developers, and anyone interested in algorithms.

## Features  
- **Custom Painter**:  
  Used to create a fully customized graphical representation of the sorting process. Instead of relying on standard animations, Custom Painter allows precise control over the visual elements, ensuring the visualization matches the algorithm's logic.  

- **Provider for State Management**:  
  Managing the application's state efficiently is critical, especially for real-time updates during the sorting process. Provider ensures seamless state updates while maintaining clean and scalable code.  

- **Flutter Widgets**:  
 
## Why These Technologies?  
- **Custom Painter** was chosen to deliver a unique and precise visualization of the sorting steps that standard widgets couldn’t achieve.  
- **Provider** simplifies the process of managing the application's state, keeping the codebase clean and adhering to modern Flutter architecture practices.  
- **Flutter Widgets** make it easy to create a visually appealing and interactive UI while maintaining performance.
